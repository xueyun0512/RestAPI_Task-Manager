## Presentation of the project 
In this project, I built a Task Manager that summarize, in a table, a bench of tasks. 
The user can create, read (access), update and delete tasks depend on the on-going achievement. <br>
On each row, there is a to-do task. Each task is caracterised by its content, the added-on date. One can select *Update* or *Delete* respectively in order to update the content of the task or delete the chosen task. 

## Table of content
1. Create your tasks
2. Delete task
3. Update task
4. Access to the database

## 1) Create your tasks
Anyone can add any task they want using the Task Manager. At first, it is an empty table and as long as the user add tasks, the table will be filled out with tasks.

<table align="center"><tr>
<td> <img src="/images/empty_table.PNG" alt="Drawing" style="width: 380px;"/> </td>
<td> <img src="/images/delete.PNG" alt="Drawing" style="width: 250px;"/> </td>
</tr></table>

## 2) Delete task
The user may have written a typo but no worries! The typo can be removed by clicking on *Delete*. <br>
(PS: it's also very satisfying when removing a task which is done!)

<table align="center"><tr>
<td> <img src="/images/typo.PNG" alt="Drawing" style="width: 250px;"/> </td>
<td> <img src="/images/delete.PNG" alt="Drawing" style="width: 250px;"/> </td>
</tr></table>

## 3) Update task
If someone changes their minds, it is possible to change the content of one task using *Update* button. Here, the user was to plan watching *Sponge Bob* but somehore, it turns out that the user opts for *Sherlock Holmes*.

<table align="center"><tr>
<td> <img src="/images/update.PNG" alt="Drawing" style="width: 250px;"/> </td>
<td> <img src="/images/sherlock_holmes.PNG" alt="Drawing" style="width: 290px;"/> </td>
</tr></table>

## 4) Access to the database
The database could be saved in the file *__task.db__*. With Visual Studio code for instance, one may do some query.

## Conclusion
This project allows me understand how Rest API works and how to implement it in a easy way. By building this API from scratch, I was able to go deeper into the notion of API. <br>
There was some difficulties at first because I had never learnt neither Html nor Flask before. I didn't know anything about web development. <br>
However, I managed to learn the required skills and learn everything needed in order to build the whole project. Now I know how to deal with html and css files as well as using Flask. <br>
It was amazing to see that the API works well!
