## Presentation of the project 
In this project, I built a Task Manager that summarize, in a table, a bench of tasks. 
The user can create, read (access), update and delete tasks depend on the on-going achievement. <br>
On each row, there is a to-do task. Each task is caracterised by its content, the added-on date. One can select *Update* or *Delete* respectively in order to update the content of the task or delete the chosen task.
